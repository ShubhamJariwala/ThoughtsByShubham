And thats okay - as long as you accept that you are not perfect and are learning form your mistakes. It is the process that is important. As long as as you donot let those negative moments define you. Instead of questioning your efforts and hardwork, put end to your doubts and trust your hard work, 
                            and never lose hope that when your time comes, its going to be better than anything you have imagined for yourself.
                            It is going to be worth the wait.
                            <br>
                            Your heart may feel like its in pieces but you are still whole. You may feel weak but you are not helpless. You are beautiful and worth living the process of life.
                            Don't you ever forget that.
                            <br>
                            Trust the part of yourself that knows there's so much more to you. There's more to life. There's more than what you're settling for.
                            <br>
                            Sometimes you really do need to break before you can fully become. And sometimes the breaking can seem like the end. But then one day, you will wake up and realize that you were always the key to healing your own heart.
